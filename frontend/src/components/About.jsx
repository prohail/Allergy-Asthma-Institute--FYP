          <p className="fs-5">
            Certainly! Allergies are a common health condition that affects
            millions of people worldwide. An allergy is an immune system
            response to a substance that the body perceives as a threat, even
            though it is harmless to most people. These substances are known as
            allergens and can include things like pollen, dust, certain foods,
            medications, and pet dander, among others.When an allergen enters
            the body, the immune system produces antibodies called
            Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to fight it off. This triggers the release of
            chemicals, such as histamine, which cause the symptoms associated
            with an allergic reaction. Common symptoms of allergies include
            sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, skin rash, and difficulty
            breathing.

          <p className="fs-5">
            Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways,
            causing them to become inflamed and narrowed, which makes it
            difficult to breathe. Asthma can range in severity from mild to
            severe and can be a lifelong condition. The exact cause of asthma is
            not known, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and
            environmental factors. Asthma triggers can include allergies,
            respiratory infections, exercise, air pollution, and stress, among
            others. Symptoms of asthma can include:WheezingShortness of
            breathChest tightnessCoughing, especially at night or early in the
